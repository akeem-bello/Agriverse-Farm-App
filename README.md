# Agriverse-Farm-App
A MERN stack app where farmers and exporters/food manufacturers can register to sell, and buy farm produce respectively. 

This was built with the intention of solving one of UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which is zero hunger by reducing food wastage due to so many reasons like inaccessibility to farms etc.

The start-up has selected farm produce it is interested in, so, farmers sign up and submit the quantities of these produce they have, as well as where the farms are located. Exporters also sign up and place orders for the farm produce they need.

We then do a pool-buying of these farm produce from farmers according to farm location, then supply the exporters/food manufacturers.

There is an admin page where the farmers' submitted produce is displayed, as well as the exporters' orders which are gotten from the database(MongoDb). Inquiries from the "Contact Us" tab are also displayed in the admin page from the database too.
